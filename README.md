VeloType is a competitive typing game that transforms typing speed, accuracy, and consistency into structured, skill-based competition.  
The project is designed around ranked progression, fair match conditions, and extensible game modes rather than traditional standalone typing tests.

---

## Overview

VeloType is built as a modern, **type-safe** frontend application to explore competitive typing mechanics beyond conventional typing platforms. Instead of measuring raw speed in isolation, the game evaluates relative performance between players, emphasizing accuracy, consistency, and decision-making under pressure.

The codebase is intentionally structured to support scalable game modes and future real-time features while maintaining clean component boundaries and predictable, strongly-typed game logic.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Skill-based evaluation** — performance is measured using speed, accuracy, and consistency rather than raw WPM alone  
- **Relative competition** — outcomes are determined by player-to-player comparison, not static thresholds  
- **Ranked progression** — ELO-style systems encourage long-term improvement  
- **Deterministic fairness** — shared text seeds ensure identical conditions for all players  
- **Type safety** — TypeScript enforces correctness in scoring, state, and game logic  
- **Extensible architecture** — new modes build on a shared typing engine

## Game Modes

### ⚔️ Ranked 1v1

A head-to-head competitive mode where two players type the same text under identical conditions.

- Best-of-round structure  
- Performance-based scoring  
- Health / damage mechanics derived from typing accuracy and speed  
- Designed for ranked matchmaking and progression  

This mode forms the competitive core of VeloType.

---

### 🧠 Precision Duels

A shorter, high-pressure format focused on accuracy and consistency.

- Reduced round duration  
- Increased penalty for errors  
- Rewards controlled, deliberate typing over pure speed  

---

### 🔥 Battle Royale (Planned)

A multi-player competitive mode built on the same core scoring system.

- All players type simultaneously  
- Performance determines interactions and eliminations  
- Designed for replayability and spectator-friendly pacing  

---

## What Makes VeloType Different

- **Competitive-first design** — built around player interaction rather than solo benchmarks  
- **Fair by construction** — deterministic text generation removes randomness  
- **Progression-focused** — ranking systems reward improvement over time  
- **Game mechanics layered on typing** — typing performance directly affects outcomes  
- **Strongly typed game logic** — TypeScript ensures predictable behavior as complexity grows

## Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines planned milestones for VeloType.  
Features are implemented incrementally, with an emphasis on correctness, fairness, and scalability.

### Phase 1 — Core Foundation (In Progress)
- [x] Deterministic typing engine
- [x] Strongly typed game logic using TypeScript
- [x] Modular frontend architecture
- [x] Repository structure cleanup and tooling polish
- [x] Environment configuration standardization

### Phase 2 — Persistence & Accounts
- [x] Backend API setup
- [x] Database integration (users, profiles, matches)
- [x] Authentication (OAuth or email-based)
- [x] User profiles with persisted settings
- [x] Match history storage and retrieval

### Phase 3 — Competitive Systems
- [ ] Ranked matchmaking queue
- [ ] Server-side ELO rating system
- [ ] Rank tiers and progression visualization
- [ ] Daily seeded leaderboards
- [ ] Anti-abuse and validation checks

### Phase 4 — Real-Time Multiplayer
- [ ] WebSocket-based match infrastructure
- [ ] Server-authoritative 1v1 match flow
- [ ] Reconnect handling and match recovery
- [ ] Latency and performance optimization

### Phase 5 — Expanded Game Modes
- [ ] Battle Royale typing mode
- [ ] Multi-round elimination mechanics
- [ ] Player targeting and interaction systems
- [ ] Spectator-friendly UI elements

### Phase 6 — Production Readiness
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Accessibility and UX refinements
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Legal and privacy documentation

## Environment

To run VeloType locally or deploy, create a `.env` file at the project root and fill in your values. Below are the required environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string for backend (leave blank if not used yet)
- `AUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for authentication (leave blank if not used yet)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Base URL for API requests from frontend (optional)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID`: Analytics or third-party integration key (optional)

You can add more variables as backend features are implemented. The app will run locally with a project-root `.env`, even if some features are stubbed.

## Backend (Phase 2 foundation)

Server scaffold lives in [server/README.md](server/README.md).

Quick start:

- Install: `cd server && npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev` (default port 4000)
- Env used: `PORT` (default 4000), `DATABASE_URL` (optional now), `AUTH_SECRET` (optional now)
- Endpoints (stub): GET /health, POST /auth/login, GET /profile, WS /ws/matchmaking

Matchmaking (current): in-memory ranked queue with expanding rating window; emits `MATCH_FOUND` { matchId, seed, config, startAt }. If `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) is set and migrations run, matches are persisted via Prisma.
